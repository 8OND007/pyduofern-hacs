# Describes the format for available Wink services

start_pairing:
  description: Pair duofern devices. Remember -  There is no pairing UI. To pick up the newly paired devices later, you need to call sync_devices and possibly restart HA.
  fields:
    timeout:
      description: timeout in seconds
      example: 60

sync_devices:
  description: Re-sync Devices (trigger after pairing, if it does not work, a restart of homeassistant may help)

clean_config:
  description: Clean the duofern config. Will erase all devices from duofern config.
    Paired devices should automatically be re-added after when they speak to duofern stick.
    Non-Paired bogous devices not. **Use with caution - not tested.**
    If you want to be sure manually edit ``.duofern.json`` and remove unwanted devices there
    Be aware that homeassistant might keep its own record of these unwanted devices - you
    have to deall with these via homeassistant GUI.

dump_device_state:
  description: dump state of all known devices as a warning. State reflects state considering all
    messages received from devices (independent from homeassistant device state).
    Purpose is to debug whether there's a discrepancy with state reflected in Homeassistant.
